# Change: Analyze unit and integration tests to create more tests and increase overall coverage

## Why
Current test coverage is insufficient for critical modules, with gaps in unit and integration tests that could lead to undetected bugs and reduced reliability.

## What Changes
- Conduct comprehensive analysis of existing unit and integration tests
- Identify coverage gaps in critical modules
- Create additional tests to achieve >95% coverage for critical modules
- Implement automated coverage analysis and reporting

## Impact
- Affected specs: nonfunctional-codebase
- Affected code: Test files, critical modules (ConfigManager, CLI, providers)
