## 1. Analysis Phase
- [x] 1.1 Run current test coverage analysis to establish baseline
- [x] 1.2 Identify critical modules requiring high coverage (ConfigManager, CLI, providers)
- [x] 1.3 Document current coverage gaps and missing test scenarios
- [x] 1.4 Analyze integration test coverage for module interactions

## 2. Test Creation Phase
- [x] 2.1 Create unit tests for uncovered code paths in ConfigManager (>95% coverage)
- [ ] 2.2 Create unit tests for uncovered code paths in CLI interface (>95% coverage)
- [ ] 2.3 Create unit tests for uncovered code paths in provider implementations (>95% coverage)
- [ ] 2.4 Create additional integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- [ ] 2.5 Add tests for error handling and edge cases

## 3. Validation and Documentation
- [ ] 3.1 Run coverage reports to verify >95% coverage achieved
- [ ] 3.2 Update test documentation and coverage targets
- [ ] 3.3 Ensure all new tests pass in CI/CD
