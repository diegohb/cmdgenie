# Change: Update README.md to include comprehensive contribution guidelines

## Why
The current README.md lacks detailed contribution guidelines, making it difficult for new contributors to understand the project's development workflow, including branching strategy, commit conventions, and OpenSpec workflow.

## What Changes
- Add comprehensive contribution section to README.md
- Document branching strategy used in the project
- Detail commit message conventions followed
- Explain the OpenSpec workflow for proposing and implementing changes

## Impact
- Affected specs: nonfunctional-codebase
- Affected code: README.md
